Why "Free PSN Gift Card Code Generators" Are a Scam
No Real Generators Exist:

PlayStation gift card codes are securely created and distributed by Sony and licensed retailers. Thereâ€™s no software or tool that can legitimately "generate" free codes.
Harmful Software Risks:

Many websites or programs claiming to be code generators install malware, spyware, or ransomware on your device. These can steal your personal data or damage your system.
Phishing Threats:

Scammers use fake generators to collect sensitive information, like your PSN login credentials, email address, or payment details, leading to account hacking or financial fraud.
Terms of Service Violations:

Even attempting to use such a tool is a violation of PlayStation's terms, which can result in your account being banned, losing access to all games and content you've purchased.
Consequences of Using Fake Generators
Account Suspension or Ban: Sony has strict policies against fraudulent activity. Using fake codes or redeeming stolen ones can lead to permanent bans.
Device Security Risks: Installing suspicious software can compromise your device, leading to data loss or expensive repairs.
Legal Repercussions: Engaging in fraud may also have legal consequences depending on your location.
